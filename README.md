# V86-UI
v86 Made by Copy. v.01 Windows Release with Read/Write abillity :)
and v.02 Android app without Write :(
To run just html version You need http server on windows or disable cors in browser, on Android html run out of the box when launched through cx-explorer on any browser, http server is created automatically. The Windows release and Android apk run standalone, no need for servers, not perfect UI but its working :)
