# V86-UI
v86 Made by Copy. v.2 Windows Release with Read/Write abillity :) but there is issue, you can use 2 drives in msdos but if you launch windows with 2 HD drives the first one will get corrupted and windows will not boot anymore :( on MSdos it works fine but in win98 its preaty awfull due to uncorrectely implemented disk reading, but at least you can write using two disks in MS-Dos.
and v.01 Android app without Write :( but i am quite happy with it, finally mouse is fully usable on smartphone so no more messed up coordinates! Fallout 1 runs perfect :)
To run just html version You need http server on windows or disable cors in browser, on Android html run out of the box when launched through cx-explorer on any browser, http server is created automatically. The Windows release and Android apk run standalone, no need for servers, not perfect UI but its working :)
