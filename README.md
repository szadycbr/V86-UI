# V86-UI
v86 with wasm js and html UI. 
You need http server on windows or disable cors in browser. On Android it run out of the box when launched through cx-explorer on any browser, http server is created automatically. not perfect UI but its my first attempt to make V86 easy and useable on smartphone;)
